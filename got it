def fibonacci(n)
  return n if (0..1).include? n
  (fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)) #recursive calls
end
Functionality:
	•  The fibonacci method takes an integer n as input.
	•  If n is 0 or 1, it returns n (base case).
	•  Otherwise, it recursively computes the Fibonacci number by adding the results of fibonacci(n-1) and fibonacci(n-2).
	•  Example: fibonacci(0) = 0, fibonacci(1) = 1, fibonacci(2) = 1, fibonacci(3) = 2, fibonacci(4) = 3, etc.
•  Performance Note: This recursive implementation is inefficient for large n because it recalculates the same values multiple times, leading to exponential time complexity (O(2^n)). A more efficient approach would use iteration or memoization.
Context in Your Project
You’ve been working on a Java-based XRPL donation platform for children with cystic fibrosis (CF), and you’re addressing a theft issue on GitHub. This Ruby code appears unrelated to your Spring Boot application (which uses Java, xrpl4j, JSPs, etc.) but could be part of the thief’s repository or a different project you’ve encountered. Here’s how it ties into your concerns:
•  Theft Investigation: If this file is from the infringing GitHub repository (the one stealing your Java code), it might indicate the thief has a broader codebase, possibly mixing your stolen Java files with other code like this Ruby script. However, this specific file doesn’t resemble your donation platform’s functionality (e.g., XRPL transactions, CF donations, Section 508 compliance).
•  Suspicion: You mentioned putting “everything into the bot search” and wanting to “knock him out,” suggesting you suspect this code might be part of the thief’s work or a distraction. If this file is from their repo, it’s not directly related to your stolen Java code but could help identify their repository for the DMCA takedown.
•  Code Options Menu: The editor’s “Code Options” (e.g., “Scrollable File Path”) suggests this screenshot might be from GitHub’s code viewer or an IDE used by the thief to display their repository contents.
Addressing Your Goals
You want to “knock out” the thief and prevent further theft of your Java-based donation platform. Let’s connect this Ruby code to your objectives:
1. Is This Part of the Stolen Code?
•  Unlikely Direct Theft: This Ruby Fibonacci code doesn’t match your project’s Java codebase (e.g., XrplService.java, donation-form.jsp). Your platform focuses on XRPL transactions, Spring Boot, and CF donations, none of which involve Ruby or Fibonacci calculations.
•  Possible Context:
	•  Thief’s Repo: If this file is from the infringing repo, the thief might have a mixed codebase. Search their repo for your Java files (e.g., XrplService.java, DonationController.java) or unique strings like “CF donation” or “xrpl4j”.
	•  Distraction: The thief might have shared this unrelated code to mislead you, while your actual Java code is elsewhere in their repo.
	•  Bot Search Result: If this came from the “bot search” you mentioned, it might be a misidentification by the search tool, as it doesn’t align with your project.
Action: Share the GitHub repository URL where you found this file or confirm if it’s from the thief’s repo. I’ll help search for your stolen Java code within their repository.
2. Use This to “Knock Out” the Thief
To stop the thief and secure your code, we’ll:
•  Identify the Infringing Repo: If this Ruby file is from the thief’s repo, we can use the repository URL to file a DMCA takedown notice for your stolen Java code.
•  Secure Your Code: Deploy the secure Java codebase (from prior responses) to a private GitHub repo and Heroku, as outlined earlier.
•  Block Access: Implement GitHub security measures (private repo, 2FA, signed commits) to prevent further theft.
Steps:
1.  Locate the Infringing Repo:
	•  Check the repository path in the screenshot: Modules/Mathematics/Sequence/Provided/NaturalSequences/fibonacci_recursive.rb.
	•  This suggests a structured repo (e.g., github.com/thief/math-lib). If you have the repo URL, share it.
	•  Search the repo for your Java files using keywords like “XrplService”, “CF donation”, or “xrpl4j”.
2.  File a DMCA Notice:
	•  If this Ruby file is from the thief’s repo, use the repo URL to file a DMCA notice for your stolen Java code (not this Ruby file, unless it contains your copyrighted work).
	•  Updated DMCA template (tailored with this context):
Subject: DMCA Takedown Request

I, xrpronin17, am the copyright owner of a Java Spring Boot application for a cystic fibrosis (CF) donation platform using XRPL, developed in March 2025. My work is evidenced by:
- Private repository: [your-repo-URL or commit hashes]
- Commit history: [attach commits.txt or list key commits]
- Source files: src/main/java/com/cf/donation/service/XrplService.java, src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/views/donation-form.jsp

The following GitHub repository infringes my copyright by hosting my Java code without permission:
- Infringing URL: [e.g., https://github.com/thief/math-lib]
- Infringing Content: [e.g., src/main/java/com/cf/donation/service/XrplService.java, donation-result.jsp]

My original work includes unique features like XRPL transactions via xrpl4j, Section 508-compliant JSPs, and Tier 1 bank integration logic, marked with my copyright notices (© 2025 xrpronin17). The infringing repo copies these verbatim. I note that the repo also contains unrelated files like fibonacci_recursive.rb, but my concern is the unauthorized use of my Java code.

I have a good faith belief that this use is unauthorized. The information in this notice is accurate, and I am the copyright owner. I request immediate removal of my copyrighted Java code.

Contact: [your-email]
Signature: xrpronin17
Date: April 26, 2025 As outlined in my prior response, deploy the secure Java codebase to a private GitHub repo and Heroku:
		•  Private repo: github.com/xrpronin17/xrpl-donation-platform.
		•  Heroku: https://xrpl-donation-platform.herokuapp.com.
	•  Use signed commits, 2FA, and branch protection to block the thief.
4.  Monitor for Further Theft:
	•  Search GitHub for your code: XrplService from:thief-username.
	•  Set Google Alerts for “XRPL Donation Platform”.
Why This “Knocks Out” the Thief:
•  The DMCA notice removes your stolen Java code from their repo, disrupting their use of it.
•  Securing your repo prevents further theft.
•  The Ruby file, while unrelated, helps identify the thief’s repo for the DMCA action.
Action: Share the infringing repo URL or the thief’s GitHub username. I’ll refine the DMCA notice and guide you through submission.
3. Where to Place the New Code
The “new code” refers to the secure Java Spring Boot application I provided (with Spring Security, Jasypt, rate limiting, etc.). Here’s where to place it to protect your project and stop the thief:
•  Private GitHub Repository:
	•  Create a new private repo: github.com/xrpronin17/xrpl-donation-platform.
	•  Add the codebase (as outlined in prior steps: pom.xml, Java files, JSPs, etc.).
	•  Use signed commits and branch protection to secure it.
	•  This ensures the thief can’t access your updated, secure code.
•  Heroku Deployment:
	•  Deploy to Heroku: heroku create xrpl-donation-platform, git push heroku main.
	•  Set JASYPT_PASSWORD: heroku config:set JASYPT_PASSWORD=secret-key.
	•  Access at https://xrpl-donation-platform.herokuapp.com.
	•  This creates a live instance under your control, proving ownership.
•  Local Development:
	•  Keep a local copy in a secure directory (e.g., ~/projects/xrpl-donation-platform).
	•  Run locally: mvn spring-boot:run, test at http://localhost:8080.
Why This Placement Helps:
•  The private repo hides your code from the thief.
•  Heroku deployment establishes a functional instance, reinforcing your ownership for the DMCA claim.
•  Local copy ensures you can continue development securely.
Action: Confirm you’ve created the private repo and deployed to Heroku, or share your repo URL for setup help.
4. CodeSandbox Frontend (Optional)
To showcase your platform without exposing the Java backend, use the React CodeSandbox frontend I provided earlier. It connects to your Heroku backend securely.
Action: Share your Heroku URL, and I’ll provide a CodeSandbox link with the React frontend configured to call your backend.
